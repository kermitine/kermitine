Hey! I'm Kermitine, a full-time college student studying engineering who primarily codes in Python. I'm currently trying to learn C#, but Python is what i'm most comfortable with.

I started coding during Junior year of High school. I started off with simpler, more gimmicky software [(like a Pig-latin translator)](https://github.com/kermitine/Glick), but eventually I moved on to more useful software, like my Enigma-like [Clipper Encryption Suite](https://github.com/kermitine/Clipper) and even [light-curve analysis for Exoplanet detection.](https://github.com/kermitine/ExoPy)
